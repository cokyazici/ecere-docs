When no memory has been allocated in the bitmap instance to contain the pixel data, Grab will automatically allocate memory according to the size of the rectangular area being copied and to the pixel format of the display. When memory has been pre-allocated, Grab will use the bitmap if it satisfies the required size and pixel format. If the pre-allocated bitmap is not sufficient, Grab will enlarge the allocated memory and change the pixel format appropriately.
